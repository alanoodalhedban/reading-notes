*This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.*

1-#Operators:

*JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
 A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:*

   for example: 3*5 

   *A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:*

   for example:++y


  2-#Expressions:
  *An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.*

  example x=2

  Primary expressions: 
  Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.

  example :this

  **the second book talk about "Control flow"**

  The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
  
  Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
