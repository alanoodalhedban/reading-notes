# charts

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.





**Creating a Chart**
t's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single canvas node to render the chart.
