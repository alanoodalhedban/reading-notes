# HTML book:

**Text :**
what the Text?

- Headings and paragraphs

- Bold, italic, emphasis

- Structural and semantic markup


*They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).*






# Introducing CSS : 

-CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that elementshould look.

-Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

-Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.


-CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.




# java script book :
 
 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 
  

  *JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE*

  *A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.* 


*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.* 

*javaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).*

*Expressions evaluate into a single value.*
