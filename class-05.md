# Images :
A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: src ,alt ,height ,width .


Image Formats: JPG ,GIF ,

-Vector Images: Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator .

-You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

# color:
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

-background-color 

-RGB Values :
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 

-Hex Codes :
Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.

-Color Names :
Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number .

-Hue :
Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have
 saturation and brightness as well as hue.

-Saturation :
Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray .

-text : There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

-You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

-You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
