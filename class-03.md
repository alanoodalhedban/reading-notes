# HTML book :
**what is the list? :**

There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,unordered, and definition.

- Ordered lists use numbers.

- Unordered lists use bullets.

- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another .

**what is boxs? :**

Every box has three available properties that
can be adjusted to control its appearance:

1-Border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). 
The border separates the edge of one box from another. 

2-Margin :
Margins sit outside the edge of the border ,You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

3-Padding :
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.


# border :
The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property
(and the values should be coded in that specific order).

# javascript book :

-An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

 -Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

javaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

-Expressions evaluate into a single value.

**switch statements:**


A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

switch (level) {

case 'One ':

title= 'Level 1 ' ;

break;

case 'Two':

tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;

break;

case ' Three' :

title = 'Level 3' ;

break ;

}


-if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

-There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
