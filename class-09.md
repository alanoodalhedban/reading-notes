-forms:

HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.


Form Controls:

-Text input

-Password input

-Text area

Form controls live inside a
<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.


action
Every <form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.


method
Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.

-Checkbox

-Radio button

-Drop Down Li st Box

-List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

-Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive .

Events :
-Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked). 

-Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon. 

-When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
