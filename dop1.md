#How does a human think:
**The mind is the set of faculties including cognitive aspects such as consciousness, imagination, perception, thinking, intelligence, judgement, language and memory,
as well as noncognitive aspects such as emotion and instinct. Under the scientific physicalist interpretation, the mind is produced at least in part by the brain. 
The primary competitors to the physicalist interpretations of the mind are idealism, substance dualism, and types of property dualism, 
and by some lights eliminative materialism and anomalous monism.
There is a lengthy tradition in philosophy, religion, psychology, and cognitive science about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.**
