**This book discusses several topics in the first section  is Introduction and then talking about HTML**

## Introduction :

This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

To get the most out of this book, you will need to know how to bui ld web pages using HTML
and CSS. Beyond that. no prior experience with programming is necessary. Learning to
program with JavaScript involves: 

1-Understanding some basic
programming concepts

2-Learning the language

3-Becoming familiar with how
it is applied by looking at
examples of how JavaScript


## HTML Chapter:

** Structure :
The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics .

The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, ). 

** Extra Markup :

- decisions & loop :

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 

switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.

-ACCESSING ELEMENTS :
DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes. 


**METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE:

getElementByld( 1 id 1)

querySel ector( 'css selector') 

-HTML5 Layout :

*APls are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites that share functionality with other programs or sites.
*APls let you write code that will make a request, asking another program or script to do something.
*APls also specify the format in which the response will be given (so that the response can be understood).
*To use an API on your website, you will need to include a script in the relevant web pages. 

-Process & Design:
If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.

## javascript :

**The ABC of Programming :

A--What is a script and how do I acreate one? 
A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 

B--How do computers fit in with the world around them?
computers create models of the world using data 

C--How do I write a script for a web page? 

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension

The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
