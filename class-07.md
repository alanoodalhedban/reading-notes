# what is Domain modeling?

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

-Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

-Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

# HTML book:

**tables**

-The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row .

-tr
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening tr tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
td elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing  tr tag.

-The th element is used just
like the td element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)


-For long tables you can split the table into a thead,
tbody, and tfoot.

# JS books:


-Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window. 


-JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

-Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other). 



-The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the
document object. It represents the web page loaded into the current
browser window or tab.

-The window object represents the current
browser window or tab. It is the topmost object
in the Browser Object Model, and it contains
other objects that tell you about the browser.
