#this article talk about JavaScript function

*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.


A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)*

#JavaScript Function Syntax :


function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)

 {
  // code to be executed
  
 }


*When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.*

#using function:

-can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.


-can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.


*Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.*


-Local Variables:
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
