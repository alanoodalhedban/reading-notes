WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names .


-In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window. 


-Document Object Model:


The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 


-DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes .


-You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 


-Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadelist. 


-From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
