**This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.**

*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages and  how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, like color ,font-size.*

*We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs ,
CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified*

Three Ways to Insert CSS:
 -External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS


h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

p {
    color: black;
}
