Functions :
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

create fun :
function hello()
{
    console.log(hello world) ;
}


calling function :
hello() ;
