# Error Handling & Debugging

-Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error.

Try to narrow down where the problem might be, then look for clues. 


-The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 


-JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number
and gives a description of the error. 


-If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
